# 3DS-Titles-Database

Thank you for looking at my database

The **`.cia`** files included in this repository are system apps. You may try to use them if you would like.

**`GameBoy Advance Virtual Console`** **`.code`** files are just the original **`.gba`** file, therefore they will not be put here because this is an anti-piracy database.

The **`.code`** files were extracted with [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9)

The **`.tik`** files were extracted with [Decrypt9WIP](https://github.com/d0k3/Decrypt9WIP)

# Thanks to:

@RedDuckss for [RedDuckss/3dsamesicons](https://github.com/RedDuckss/3dsgamesicons). I was using the icons from his repo. (He did not make them for just me)
